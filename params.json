{"name":"Xcamshift","tagline":"xcamshift - a port of the camshift chemical shift force-field for xplor-nih","body":"XCamShift\r\n=========\r\n\r\n\r\nXCamShift (XCS) is a new implementation of the camshift chemical shift force field[^1] for XPLOR-NIH [^2]. The camshift implementation has a number of interesting and useful features\r\n\r\n* It is very thoroughly tested against the original camshift implementation in almost [^3] and has a large and full test suite which checks that XCS produces results that are identical with camshift in almost.\r\n* XCS uses cython[^4] to give a forcefield with native performance written in python\r\n* XCS provides extensions against the standard camshift forcefield including the ability to carry out  ensemble calculations, weighting of shift terms and variable well widths to allow for variation in statistical errors in measured chemical shift.\r\n* XCS is modular and individual chemical shift terms can be re weighted during calculations and there is scope for whole components of the force field [e.g hydrogen bonding, aromatic ring currents etc] to be modified or replaced independently. \r\n* XCS provides simple human readable files defining the components of the force field.\r\n* XCS is open source and is free software under the Library Gnu Public License (LGPL)\r\n\r\nFor information on how to install, compile and use XCS see the sections below.\r\n\r\nThe Details\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nXCamShift can be installed from pre compiled binaries or can be compiled on the users own computer targeting a particular installation of xplor-nih. The precompiled binary python modules includes all the software required to run XCS and you should not require any other software to be installed other than XPLOR-NIH    \r\n\r\n\r\n1. OSX x86_64 (64 bit): xcamshift_1.0_osx_x86_64.tgz (check sum xcamshift_1.0_osx_x86_64.tgz.md5sum)\r\n2. Linux x86_64 (64 bit)\r\n3. Linux x86_64 (32 bit) - coming\r\n4. OSX i686 (32 bit) - available if required\r\n6. sources: see downloading the source from Github [below](#download_source) \r\n\r\nbefore you install you should \r\n\r\n1. if md5sum is installed checks the md5sum of the download is correct <code>md5sum XCamShift_xxx.tgz</code>  [on OS X you will need <code>md5 -r XCamShift_xxx.tgz</code> instead]. The md5sum is stored in XCamShift_xxx_md5.txt \r\n2. extracts the archive XCamShift_xxx.tgz into a convenient temporary directory using the command <code>tar -zxvf XCamShift_xxx.tgz</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nthe easiest way to install XCamShift is to run the installation command\r\n \r\n        install_dist.sh <dist_dir> <install_dir>\r\n\r\nwhich is included with the distribution. When using this command replace <code>\\<dist_dir\\></code> with the path to the directory that contains the xcamshift distribution (this is the directory that contains the <code>install_dist.sh</code> file itself) and <code>install_dir</code> is the directory that contains the particular xplor distribution to install into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> __NOTE 1.__  if you want to use XCamShift without modifying your xplor-nih installation see the section [setting paths](#setting-paths) below\r\n\r\n>----\r\n\r\n> __NOTE 2.__  In summary this is what install_dist.sh does\r\n ( in the following <code>xxx</code> refers to a specific version e.g. v1, <code>\\<platform\\></code> is a computer platform  e.g. OSX or Linux  and <code>\\<architecture\\></code> is a cpu architecture  e.g. x86_64 or i686)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n> 1. move the .so files in xcamshift_xxx/modules into the folder <code>python/bin.\\<platform>\\_\\<architecture></code> in you xplor installation; on OSX \\<platform> will be Darwin_\\<XX> (where \\<XX> is the darwin version) and just Linux for linux. \\<architecture> will be either X86_64 or i686 for 64 and 32 bit computers respectively.\r\n2. Move the directory database/XCamShift which contains the forcefield definition into the database directory of your XPLOR-NIH installation.\r\n3. copy the contents of the camshift_xxx/python directory into the python directory of your xplor distribution\r\n4. test the installation by running the script <code>src/suite.py</code> with the command line <code>pyXplor src/suite.py</code>. You shouldn't see any errors of the form <code>fail</code> or <code>error</code> or <code>abnormal program termination</code>; any of these show a bug is present and should be reported as described in bug reporting below.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Using XCamShift\r\n\r\nXCS can only be accessed from the python interface of xplor NIH currently. Here are some snippets showing how to carry out the main operations required to run XCS.\r\n\r\n######importing shifts\r\n\r\n \r\n    csFile=open(\"test_data/alvin/cs.dat\")\r\n    cs=csFile.read()\r\n    csFile.close()\r\n\r\nthe format of a chemical shift restraint file is detail below under restraints\r\n\r\n######setting up a calculation\r\n\r\n    from XCamShift import XCamShift\r\n    XCamShift.addRestraints(cs)\r\n    potList.append(XCamShift)\r\n    \r\n######setting up weights\r\n\r\n    XCamShift.setScale(6) # this will change the weights of all terms\r\n\r\n\r\n######Format of the xcamshift restraint list\r\n\r\ncamshift restraint files are typical xplor restraints files and accept acclamation marks (!) as comments that run to the end of lines. The format is\r\n\r\n    <weight-statement>|<class-statement>| <assign-statement>\r\n\r\n    weight-statement = WEIGht <float>\r\n    class-statement = CLASs <four-letter-code> \r\n    assign-statement = ASSIgn <selection> <float>|\r\n                       ASSIgn <selection> <float> <float>\r\n\r\nthe <code>weight</code> and <code>\\<class></code> statement set weights for all following <code>\\<assign></code> statements. <assign> statements can take either  one and two float values which are in order: the chemical shift and the error of the chemical shift. It is not possible to set individual weights without also setting an error without recourse to the <code>weight</code> statement. The <code>class</code> statement can be used to tag shifts for later manipulation (currently you can just use this to reset the weight of a set of restraints.\r\n\r\nAn example of an XCamShift restraint file would be \r\n\r\n    class TEST                                     ! this is a comment\r\n    assign ( resid 2 and name C ) 177.477          ! restraint with default error\r\n    weight 2.0\r\n    assign ( resid 3 and name C ) 175.002 0.1      ! error is 0.1 weight 2.0\r\n    weight 0.5\r\n    assign ( resid 4 and name C ) 176.647 1.0      ! error 1.0 weight 0.5\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that chemical shift restraint files can't currently take sophisticated expressions as provided by the classic xplor syntax.\r\n\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\n1. restraints from the first and last residues in a segment are ignored and a warning issued as these shift cannot be used by camshift as it calculates shifts for the atoms in the central residue of a triple of residues\r\n2. segments with less than 3 residues are ignored and a warning is issued again because camshift as it calculates shifts for the atoms in the central residue of a triple of residues\r\n \r\n######Restraint objects\r\n\r\nRestraint objects can be retrieved from the XCamShift forcefield using the method <code>getRestraints()</code> on the XCamShift potential object. Restraint objects have the following attributes\r\n\r\n* obs \t    -  the observed shift (can be set)\r\n* calcd    -  the last calculated shift, if shifts have been calculated\r\n* diff      -  obs - diff\r\n* err       -  the err on the observed shift this will be the 1/2 width of the square well where no forces will be applied (can be set)\r\n* weight\t- the weight of the shift\t(can be set)\r\n* comment   - any end of line comment present when the shift was read in\r\n* name      - the name of the atom being restrained (segid resid restype atom-name)\r\n* calcd2    - calcd**2\r\n* obs2      - obs**2\r\n\r\n######Restraint statistics\r\n\r\nthe XCamShift force field object provides the following methods to retrieve information about the number of restraint and violations\r\n\r\n* rms - the rms of diff between obs and calcd (see below for how a threshold is set) \r\n* violations - the number of violations\r\n* numRestraints - the number of restraints\r\n\r\nAs the range of chemical shifts is not uniformly distributed the value of the threshold [set using the attribute <code>threshold</code> of the forcefield] for restraint violations has to be treated differently and is used as a multiplier of the error. Therefore a restraint is violated when the following equality tests true\r\n\r\n    |diff| > threshold * err + err\r\n\r\n######Listing predicted shifts\r\n\r\nThe chemical shifts predicted by XCamShift can be printed using the methods <code>print_shifts</code> of the potential. The shifts are printed in the following format\r\n\r\n    SEGID     RESID    RES        HA       CA       HN        N        C       CB\r\n    |AGB3|    2        GLN    4.5501  54.2330   8.7379 121.0727 175.1000  29.2632\r\n    |AGB3|    3        TYR    5.0569  56.5513   9.5938 123.5669 174.7284  40.6070\r\n    |AGB3|    4        LYS    4.8969  54.5661   9.4434 121.8343 174.0538  35.2424\r\n    |AGB3|    5        LEU    4.6559  52.7604   9.2490 124.7154 174.3615  43.3438\r\n    |AGB3|    6        VAL    4.2273  60.9981   8.9896 124.2064 174.2570  32.7248\r\n    |AGB3|    7        ILE    4.2590  59.6785   9.0951 126.6597 174.7850  37.6970\r\n    |AGB3|    8        ASN    4.6711  51.7622   9.3382 125.9824 173.3525  38.0188\r\n    |AGB3|    9        GLY    4.0863  45.1157   8.6680 110.2235 174.1825        .\r\n    |AGB3|    10       LYS    3.9673  58.6702   9.3420 122.0362 176.9272  31.7829\r\n    |AGB3|    11       THR    4.2896  63.8501   8.1219 113.1026 174.1789  69.9168\r\n    ...\r\n    |AGB3|    54       VAL    4.4473  59.3198   8.6110 121.8589 173.1164  32.8183\r\n    |AGB3|    55       THR    4.8757  60.3260   8.6678 120.6908 173.4372  71.6735\r\n\r\nnote that missing chemical shifts which are structuraly possible e.g. GLY CB are replaced by a <code>.</code> and that segids are wrapped with a  <code>||</code> pair to make spaces visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Rebuilding XCamShift\r\n\r\nYou should only need to recompile XCamShift if you want to make changes to the code in XCamShift,  re-compile it on a system which isn't supported or use a different compiler. If you only need to recompile with a different compiler or different target version of xplor-nih you won't need cython, you can just recompile the C code produced by cython.\r\n\r\n####Pre requisites\r\n\r\nTo rebuild the camshift tables (it is unlikely that you will need to do this!)  if you are running on an older version of python you may need to build argparse[^5] and add it to the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>\r\n\r\n####[Downloading the source from Github](id:download_source)\r\n\r\nsource code can be downloaded from the github master branch using the following link: <code>locsmith/xcamshift/archive/master.zip</code> to clone the complete repository us the the following command <code>git clone https://github.com/locsmith/xcamshift.git</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n####Rebuilding the C code\r\n\r\n1. Firstly make sure you have a compiler that is compatible with GCC. On linux GCC ~~and ICC~~ have been tested. On OSX I have only used GCC from the homebrew project not Clang.\r\n2. Make sure you have installed the source for your distribution of XPLOR-NIH\r\n3. Download the source code for the version of python you want to target and build it. To test which version of python explore is using run <code>\\<xplor-nih directory>/bin/pyXplor test.py</code> with test.py containing  <code>import sys ; print sys.version</code>. This will give you the version of python, typically the first line of output should be of the form <code>2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05)</code> and in this case the version is 2.7.5. \r\n4. edit <code>build_all.py</code> and change the variables\r\n5. run <code>build_all.py</code>\r\n\r\n####[Setting Paths](id:setting_paths)\r\nXCamShift can be tested without modifying xplor-nih by adding the following to you PYTHONPATH\r\n\r\n<code>\\<XCamShift-directory\\>/src/cython:\\<XCamShift-directory\\>/XCamShift/src</code>\r\n\r\nwhere <XCamShift-directory> is the directory that contains the XCamShift distribution\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is not installed you will also need to install PyYAML[^8] and add it's installation directory to the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> variable\r\n\r\n####Testing XCamShift\r\n\r\nIf XCamShift is installed or the paths are correctly set XCamShift can be tested using the following command\r\n\r\n<code>pyXplor \\<XCamShift-directory\\>/src/test/test_XCamShift_print_shifts.py</code>\r\n\r\nif they are not installed already you will also have to add python paths for the following python packages if you want to run the tests\r\n\r\n1. nanotime[^7]\r\n2. unittest2[^6]\r\n\r\n####Reporting bugs\r\n\r\nBugs happen! XCamShift is well test but new code, please report bugs (or make requests for enhancements or even submit enhancements!) on the XCamShift github site: \r\n\r\nThe author can also be contacted at <code>g dot s dot thompson at leeds dot ac dot uk</code>\r\n\r\n####Caveats\r\n1. XCamShift calculates chemical shifts for hydrogen bonds but doesn't calculate any forces in the same manner as the original version. The hydrogen bond shift calculator can be disabled using the following code <code>\\<xcamshift-potential\\>.remove_named_sub_potential('HBOND')</code> where <code>\\<xcamshift-potential\\></code> is the xcamshift potential instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Tested versions\r\n\r\n* __Targeted version of Camshift:__ XCamShift is currently tested against version 1.35.0 of camshift which is implemented in almost 1.04.\r\n* __Supported versions of XPLOR-NIH:__ XCamShift currently supports version of XPLOR-NIH from 2.31 to 2.35 and the precompiled binaries are compiled against XPLOR-NIH 2.35.Please note that for some versions of xplor-nih before 2.35 you may need to recompile from source as the interface for the ensemble code has changed (this definitely included xplor-nih 2.33).  \r\n*  __Compiler environment:__ XCamShift binaries are compiled with GCC version 4.8.2 on OSX and Cython 0.20.2 (Note Cython is only required if the python code is modified, XCamShift can be re-compiled from the C++ source without Cython being present).\r\n* __Targetted platforms:__ XCamShift can be used on OSX and Linux under either a 32Bit or 64Bit intel environment (however 32bit OSX is not tested). \r\n\r\n\r\n###Citing XCamShift\r\n\r\nThere is currently no paper for XCamShift (I hope there will be one soon!). Until there is please cite: __XCamShift__ G.S.Thompson, Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, UK [http://github.com/locsmith/xcamshift]\r\n\r\n###References\r\n\r\n\r\n[^1]: __camshift:__ Kohlhoff, K.J. et al. 2009.
