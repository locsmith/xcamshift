1. add smoothed distance potentials and shifts?? - maybe not needed always false in original camshift, maybe just need to implement beyond harmonic term
2. non harmonic potential positions - done
3. well potential positions -done 
4. non bonded interactions
5. aromatic potential and forces
6. glycine an proline tables
7. test data generation scripts for comprehensive tests suite
8. code force and energy routines in C
9. rename factors scalings??
10. add parameter class to hand down  parameters from xcamshift to
11. add factor and lambda to give fact in xcamshift._calc_single_factor
12. check ala tanh  forces and energy components (effectively already checked by 
check other forces and the factors in the tanh regime) 
13. add derivatives for torsion angles - done
14 add code to read chemical shifts

speed:
------

1. ring normals and centres -  done
2. non bonded list - done
3. distance forces - done
4. dihedral forces -dome
5. ring forces -done
6. flatten calc_shifts -done 
7. add a factor calculator - done
8. check non bonded implementation
9. check caches are updated per round -calculated shifts and non bonded list
10. check two different structures for forces
11. look at energy anf forces for gb3 and ubi at minimum and away from minimum
12. parameters used by kai?
13 Useful in particular was his
implementation of the method of finite differences that helped testing whether all forces were
derived correctly.
