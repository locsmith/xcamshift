1. add smoothed distance potentials and shifts?? - maybe not needed always false in original camshift, maybe just need to implement beyond harmonic term
2. non harmonic potential positions
3. well potential positions
4. non bonded interactions
5. aromatic potential and forces
6. glycine an proline tables
7. test data generation scripts for comprehensive tests suite
8. code force and energy routines in C
