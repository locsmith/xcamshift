###Installation


to make an installation you should run the installation command
 
        install_dist.sh <dist_dir> <install_dir>
which is included with the distribution. When using this command replace <code>\<dist_dir\></code> with the path to the directory that contains the xcamshift distribution (this is the directory that contains the <code>install_dist.sh</code> file itself) and <code>install_dir</code> is the directory that contains the particular xplor distribution to install into.



> __NOTE__  if you want to use XCamShift without modifying your xplor-nih installation see the section _setting paths_ of the README
