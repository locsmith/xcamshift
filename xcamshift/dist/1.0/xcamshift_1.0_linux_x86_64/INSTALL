Installation

to make an installation you should run the installation command

        install_dist.sh <dist_dir> <install_dir>

which is included with the distribution. When using this command replace
<dist_dir> with the path to the directory that contains the xcamshift
distribution (this is the directory that contains the install_dist.sh
file itself) and install_dir is the directory that contains the
particular xplor distribution to install into.

  NOTE if you want to use XCamShift without modifying your xplor-nih
  installation see the section _setting paths_ of the README
